# Pima Indians Diabetes
# 📝1- Project Overview
The project aims to analyze and predict diabetes among Pima Indian women based on various factors such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, and age. The project utilizes statistical algorithms and machine learning techniques to identify patterns contributing to diabetes.
# ⌛2- Process Details
The project follows these steps:
1. Importing and cleaning data (handling missing values).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand variable relationships and data distribution.
3. Data preprocessing and normalization for model training.
4. Applying machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks.
5. Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
# ⌛🔍3- Analysis
- Analyzed the relationship between glucose levels and diabetes, showing that higher glucose levels increase the risk.
- Examined the effect of age and BMI, revealing that older individuals and those with higher BMI are more likely to have diabetes.
- Tested different models to determine which provides the best accuracy in predicting diabetes.
# 💡4- Key Insights
- High glucose levels are the strongest indicator of diabetes.
- Age over 40 and high BMI increase the risk of diabetes.
- The best-performing models were Random Forest and SVM based on evaluation metrics.
- Improving data quality could enhance model accuracy.
# 📊5- Visualization
- Scatter plots of glucose vs. age to understand their correlation.
- Confusion matrix to compare model performance.
- Boxplots and histograms to analyze data distribution and trends.
